# French English Flashcards

Most people would like to learn a new language but the sheer amount of words to memorise can be overwheling. Using the Oxford English Dictionary as a metric, English alone has a whopping 615,100 words
. Quite frankly, we don't use that many words in our day to day lives and you can get by with just knowing the basic and most commonly used words. 

This simple Tkinter Flashcard app could be a great tool for someone looking to learn  the most commonly used French words to have little conversations. 

## App Overview
The front of the flashcard containes the French word, while the back contains the English translation. The card flips over after 1second, to reveal the english translation.

The red "X" button changes the card. If you have already mastered a word, you can remove it from the list of words to learn by pressing the green "âœ”" button.
